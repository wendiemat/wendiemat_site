      this page will have 2 cards side by side the one side will have 'the
      developer' and the other 'the designer' with a bit of a description as to
      how and what that wendy does nad what tools and technologies she uses for
      her projects. the 2 cards should zoom in as you hover over them simply to
      make the user want to click on them

      list of technologies i am familiar with, i should also use the cv hloni
      made to help me with this. i should link my github and showcase the
      projects carousel. also mention my computer science degree and all the
      modules i have done. i could also make a gradient color box with gradients
      i have created from canva into a github like how matt does on the shecodes
      css gradients webpage
